# How was this developed?


## Backend (Node.js, Express, GraphQL, MongoDB, Mongoose):

	1.	Node.js and Express Setup:
	•	Installed Node.js and npm on our machines.
	•	Used npm init to set up our Node.js project.
	•	Installed Express using npm install express.
	2.	GraphQL Setup:
	•	Installed required packages: npm install express-graphql graphql.
	•	We had to set up a basic GraphQL schema using tools like apollo-server.
	3.	MongoDB and Mongoose Setup:
	•	Installed MongoDB on our machines and used a cloud service.
	•	Installed Mongoose with npm install mongoose.
	•	Connected our Express app to MongoDB using Mongoose.
	4.	Define GraphQL Schema:
	•	Defined our GraphQL schema with types, queries, and mutations.
	5.	Queries and Mutations:
	•	Implemented GraphQL resolvers for queries and mutations.
	•	Used Mongoose to interact with our MongoDB database.
	6.	Authentication:
	•	Implemented user authentication using JWT. We used libraries like jsonwebtoken for this.
	7.	API Key for NASA:
	•	Obtained an API key from NASA and stored it securely.

Frontend (React, NASA API Integration, UI):

	1.	React Setup:
	•	Created a new React app using create-react-app.
	2.	NASA API Integration (Frontend):
	•	Set up a React component to fetch data from NASA’s API using fetch or axios.
	•	Displayed the retrieved data in our UI.
	3.	Polished UI:
	•	Designed a polished user interface with React components and styles.
	•	Considered using a component library like Material-UI or Ant Design for a polished look.
	4.	Interactivity:
	•	Enhanced interactivity with React features like state, props, and event handling.
	5.	Authentication (Frontend):
	•	Implemented user authentication in our React app. Managed authentication state and protected authenticated routes.
	6.	Testing:
	•	Wrote tests for both our backend and frontend components to ensure reliability.
	7.	Deployment:
	•	Deployed our app on Render.

## Usage

Use the NavBar to navigate through the site itself. In the search bars enter the start date and then an end date and hit submit to find the best pictures of each of those days. You can sign up and login, which will allow you to save pictures to your user account so you can keep track of your favorite pictures.


## Contributing

Others can contribute by adding a callendar function and other third part nasa api so you can save the dates of certain astrological events such as meteor showers, full moons, shooting stars, solar/lunar eclipses, northern lights and many more!!! That way you will never miss a STELLAR event.
